# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The slope of the linear model is not zero based on the R squared value of .71 adjusted R-squared at .68. The MPG for the MechaCar will be effective.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
For MechaCare suspension coils must not exceed 100. The MechaCar suspension coils variance does not exceed 100, coming in at 62.3, but Lot 3 falls short with a variance exceeding 100 significantly at 170.
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
The p-value in order to reject the null hypothesis has to be .05 or under. The p-value for this data is .06. We can not reject the null hypothesis. 
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
The null hypothesis shows the two competitors are statistically similar. Studing the cost, fuel efficiency, safety ratings, HP, and AWD would be a great recommendation for this research study. A t-test would be useful, due to it being very easy and straight-forward to use.
